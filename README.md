# band-maps

## What is it?

It's a project to take a band, scrape the related bands from Wikipedia, enter them into a network, then graph it.

## How have I done it?

Python in a jupyter notebook.

## What do you need?

Relevant Python libraries are:
```
requests
pandas
wikipedia
bs4
matplotlib
networkx
```

## What's next?

It's a work in progress at the moment. I might deploy it as a web app, or just create a load of graphs and make a gallery on my github.pages blog. I'm not looking for collabs or anything, but feel free to take anything you want from it.
